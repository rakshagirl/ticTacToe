# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello! We are Rakshinee, Isha, Sruthi, and Cathy and we made Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple, yet fun game to play with your friends. We created this game using Python.

How to play:
When it is your turn, select a square that has not been taken on the 3 X 3 tic-tac-toe grid. Your goal is to get 3 in a row, diagonally, or in a column without your opponent blocking you!
